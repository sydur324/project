                        A major goal of this course is the development of effective technical writing skills.
                        To help you become an accomplished writer, you will prepare several research papers based upon the studies
                        completed in lab. Our research papers are not typical "lab reports."
                        In a teaching lab a lab report might be nothing more than answers to a set of questions. Such an
                        assignment hardly represents the kind of writing you might be doing in your eventual career.

                        You alone are responsible for developing such skills to a high level.

                            An objective of organizing a research paper is to allow people to read your work selectively.
                            When I research a topic, I may be interested in just the methods, a specific result, the
                            interpretation, or perhaps I just want to see a summary of the paper to determine if it
                            is relevant to my study. To this end, many journals require the following sections,
                            submitted in the order listed, each section to start on a new page.
                            There are variations of course. Some journals call for a combined results and discussion,
                            for example, or include materials and methods after the body of the paper.
                            The well known journal Science does away with separate sections altogether,
                            except for the abstract.

                            requirements that are shared by many journals in the life sciences.

                            Write your summary after the rest of the paper is completed. After all,
                            how can you summarize something that is not yet written? Economy of words is
                            important throughout any paper, but especially in an abstract. However,
                            use complete sentences and do not sacrifice readability for brevity.
                            You can keep it concise by wording sentences so that they serve more
                            than one purpose. For example, "In order to learn the role of protein
                            synthesis in early development of the sea urchin, newly fertilized embryos
                            were pulse-labeled with tritiated leucine, to provide a time course of changes
                            in synthetic rate, as measured by total counts per minute (cpm)."
                            This sentence provides the overall question, methods, and type of analysis,
                            all in one sentence. The writer can now go directly to summarizing the results.

                                theoretical point of view as well as indicate practical reasons for using it.
                            </p>
                            <p>3 . Provide a rationale. State your specific hypothesis(es) or objective(s),
                                and describe the reasoning that led you to select them.
                            </p>
                            <p>4 . Very briefy describe the experimental design and how it accomplished the stated objectives.</p>
                            <p>5 . Use past tense except when referring to established facts. After all,
                                the paper will be submitted after all of the work is completed.
                            </p>
                            <p>6 . Organize your ideas, making one major point with each paragraph.
                                If you make the four points listed above,
                                you will need a minimum of four paragraphs.
                            </p>
                            <p>7 . Present background information only as needed in order support a position.

                                everything you know about a subject.
                            </p>
                            <p>8 . State the hypothesis/objective precisely - do not oversimplify.</p>
                            <p>9 . As always, pay attention to spelling, clarity and appropriateness of sentences and phrases.</p>

                            There is no specific page limit, but a key concept is to keep this section as concise as you
                            possibly can. People will want to read this material selectively. The reader may only be
                            interested in one formula or part of a procedure. Materials and methods may be
                            reported under separate subheadings within this section or can be incorporated together.

                            This should be the easiest section to write, but many students misunderstand the purpose.
                            The objective is to document all specialized materials and general procedures, so that another
                            individual may use some or all of the methods in another study or judge the scientific merit of
                            your work. It is not to be a step by step description of everything you did, nor is a methods
                            section a set of instructions. In particular, it is not supposed to tell a story.
                            By the way, your notebook should contain all of the information that you need for this section.

                            <p>1 . Describe materials separately only if the study
                                is so complicated that it saves space this way.
                            </p>
                            <p>2 . Include specialized chemicals, biological materials, and any equipment or
                                supplies that are not commonly found in laboratories.
                            </p>
                            <p>3 . Do not include commonly found supplies such as test tubes, pipet tips, beakers, etc.,
                                or standard lab equipment such as centrifuges, spectrophotometers, pipettors, etc.
                            </p>
                            <p>4 . If use of a specific type of equipment, a specific enzyme, or a culture from a particular
                                supplier is critical to the success of the experiment, then it and the source should be
                                singled out, otherwise no.
                            </p>
                            <p>5 . Materials may be reported in a separate paragraph or else they may be
                                identified along with your procedures.
                            </p>
                            <p>6 . In biosciences we frequently work with solutions -
                                refer to them by name and describe completely,
                                including concentrations of all reagents, and pH of aqueous solutions, solvent if non-aqueous.

                            <p>1 . See the examples in the writing portfolio package
                            </p>
                            <p>2 . Report the methodology (not details of each procedure that employed the same methodology)
                            </p>
                            <p>3 . Describe the mehodology completely, including such specifics as temperatures, incubation times, etc.
                            </p>
                            <p>4 .To be concise, present methods under headings devoted to specific procedures or groups of procedures
                            </p>
                            <p>5 . Generalize - report how procedures were done, not how they were specifically performed on a particular day. For example, report "samples were diluted to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml protein;" don't report that "135 microliters of sample one was diluted with 330 microliters of buffer to make the protein concentration 2 mg/ml." Always think about what
                                would be relevant to an investigator at another institution, working on his/her own project.
                            </p>
                            <p>6 . If well documented procedures were used, report the procedure by name, perhaps with
                                reference, and that's all. For example, the Bradford assay is well known. You need not report the
                                procedure in full - just that you used a Bradford assay to estimate protein concentration,
                                and identify what you used as a standard.
                                The same is true for the SDS-PAGE method, and many other well known procedures in biology and biochemistry.
                            </p>

                            <p>1 . It is awkward or impossible to use active voice when documenting methods without
                                using first person, which would focus the reader's attention on the investigator
                                rather than the work. Therefore when writing up
                                the methods most authors use third person passive voice.
                            </p>
                            <p>2 . Use normal prose in this and in every other section of the paper – avoid informal lists, and use complete sentences.

                                    Journal guidelines vary. Space is so valuable in the Journal of Biological Chemistry,
                                    that authors are asked to restrict discussions to four pages or less, double spaced,

                                    the limit will be extended to five typed pages. If you practice economy of words,
                                    that should be plenty of space within which to say all that you need to say.

                                    support for all of your conclusions, using evidence from your experiment
                                    and generally accepted knowledge,
                                    if appropriate. The significance of findings should be clearly described.

                                    Interpret your data in the discussion in appropriate depth.
                                    This means that when you explain a phenomenon you must describe mechanisms
                                    that may account for the observation. If your results differ from your expectations,
                                    explain why that may have happened. If your results agree, then describe the theory
                                    that the evidence supported.
                                    It is never appropriate to simply state that the data agreed with expectations,
                                    and let it drop at that.
                                </p>

                                <p>1 . Decide if each hypothesis is supported, rejected, or if you cannot make a decision with confidence. Do not simply dismiss a study or part of a study as "inconclusive."</p>
                                <p>2 . Research papers are not accepted if the work is incomplete. Draw what conclusions you can based upon the results that you have, and treat the study as a finished work</p>
                                <p>3 . You may suggest future directions, such as how the experiment might be modified to accomplish another objective.</p>
                                <p>4 . Explain all of your observations as much as possible, focusing on mechanisms.</p>
                                <p>5 . Decide if the experimental design adequately addressed the hypothesis, and whether or not it was properly controlled.</p>
                                <p>5 . Try to offer alternative explanations if reasonable alternatives exist.</p>
                                <p>6 . One experiment will not answer an overall question, so keeping the big picture in mind, where do you go next? The best studies open up new avenues of research. What questions remain?</p>
                                <p>7 . Recommendations for specific papers will provide additional suggestions.</p>
                                <p>8 . When you refer to information, distinguish data generated by your own studies from published information or from information obtained from other students (verb tense is an important tool for accomplishing that purpose).</p>
                                <p>9 . Refer to work done by specific individuals (including yourself) in past tense.</p>
                                <p>10 . Refer to generally accepted facts and principles in present tense. For example, "Doofus, in a 1989 survey, found that anemia in basset hounds was correlated with advanced age. Anemia is a condition in which there is insufficient hemoglobin in the blood."</p>

                                The biggest mistake that students make in discussions is to present a superficial
                                interpretation that more or less re-states the results. It is necessary
                                to suggest why results came out as they did, focusing on the mechanisms
                                behind the observations.
