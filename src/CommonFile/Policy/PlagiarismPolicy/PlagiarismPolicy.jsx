                    The editorial board is very strict regarding plagiarism. The journal believes
                    that taking the ideas and work of others without giving them credit is unfair
                    and dishonest. Copying even one sentence from someone else's manuscript, or
                    even one of your own that has previously been published, without proper citation
                    is considered plagiarism-use your own words instead. The editorial board retains
                    the absolute authority to reject the review process of a submitted manuscript if
                    it subject to minor or major
                    plagiarism and even may cancel the publication upon the complaint of victim(s) of plagiarism.
