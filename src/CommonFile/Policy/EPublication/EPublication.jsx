                    E-Publication First<sup>TM</sup> is a feature offered through our journal platform.
                    It allows PDF version of manuscripts that have been peer reviewed and accepted,
                    to be hosted online prior to their inclusion in a final printed journal. Readers can freely access or cite the article.

                    The journal follows double blind peer review policy. The paper is sent to two reviewers
                    (the experts in respective field) to review the paper in the light of journal's
                    guidelines and features of a quality research paper. For papers which require changes,
                    the same reviewers will be used to ensure that the quality of the revised paper is acceptable.

                    Copyrights for articles published in the journal are retained by the authors, with first

                <p className="my-6 text-[#262626e2]">
                    The editorial board is very strict regarding plagiarism. The journal believes
                    that taking the ideas and work of others without giving them credit is unfair
                    and dishonest. Copying even one sentence from someone else's manuscript, or
                    even one of your own that has previously been published, without proper citation
                    is considered plagiarism-use your own words instead. The editorial board retains
                    the absolute authority to reject the review process of a submitted manuscript if
                    it subject to minor or major
                    plagiarism and even may cancel the publication upon the complaint of victim(s) of plagiarism.
